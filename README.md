# Precipitation Prediction 

## Usage
To get started with all the dependencies, run 
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To download the dataset, the shell command
```sh
python3 get_data.py
```
will download the relevant data and randomly sample
100 files from the dataset. The sampled files are
stored in the `data` folder.


## Timetable
I just chose some of the deadline dates for the 
aggregation of work arbitrarily. Feel free to
change this :)

## Versioning
We will start with using Python **3.11.11** and 
potentially change the version based on compability
with the chosen models.
